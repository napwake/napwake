# Upgrading

## General Upgrade Process

1. **Read the release notes** in the [changelog](https://github.com/okedeji/hybernate/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for the target version. Check for breaking changes, CRD schema changes, or required steps.

2. **Upgrade.** The CRD is upgraded with the operator:

    === "Helm"

        ```bash
        helm upgrade hybernate oci://ghcr.io/okedeji/charts/hybernate \
          --version X.Y.Z \
          --namespace hybernate-system
        ```

        The chart is only published as an OCI artifact: there's no `helm repo` to update. Its version has no `v`. The CRD is a template in the chart, so `helm upgrade` upgrades it too, unless you installed with `crds.install: false` and manage it yourself.

    === "kubectl"

        ```bash
        kubectl apply -f https://github.com/okedeji/hybernate/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/install.yaml
        ```

3. **Verify the upgrade:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n hybernate-system
    kubectl logs -n hybernate-system -l control-plane=controller-manager --tail=20
    ```

4. **Check workloads:** Verify ManagedWorkloads are reconciling correctly:

    ```bash
    kubectl get managedworkloads --all-namespaces
    ```

## Narrowing watchNamespaces

Upgrading to a `watchNamespaces` that leaves out a namespace, or setting it where it was empty, removes the operator's and the doorman's Roles in the namespaces left out, and stops them watching there. Workloads paused in those namespaces would stay at zero replicas, their Services still routed to doorman ports nothing serves, and their ManagedWorkloads' finalizers would never run.

So the chart refuses it. A pre-upgrade hook, the `<fullname>-upgrade-guard` Job, lists the ManagedWorkloads the running operator took on, with its `hybernate.io/cleanup` finalizer, in namespaces the new `watchNamespaces` leaves out, and fails if there are any, before anything changes: `helm upgrade` stops with `job hybernate-upgrade-guard failed`, and Helm prints them, with the steps below. It waits two and a half minutes for any being deleted first. `helm rollback` to a revision with a narrower `watchNamespaces` is guarded the same way.

To narrow it, stop managing the workloads in the namespaces you're dropping first, while the operator still watches them, so it scales each one back up:

1. Remove the `hybernate.io/managed` label from the workloads and namespaces there.
2. Delete the ManagedWorkloads you wrote yourself there:

    ```bash
    kubectl delete managedworkloads --all -n preview-1
    ```

3. Upgrade.

The hook reads ManagedWorkloads' metadata cluster-wide, through a ClusterRole that, like its ServiceAccount, exists only while it runs. It runs only when `watchNamespaces` is set: widening to every namespace strands nothing. Argo CD runs it as a PreSync hook, before every sync. `helm upgrade --no-hooks` skips it, and `guard.upgrade: false` drops it; then restore the workloads left behind by hand, as in [Restoring workloads after the operator is gone](../getting-started/installation.md#restoring-workloads-after-the-operator-is-gone), for those namespaces.

A refused upgrade is recorded as a failed revision, and the release keeps running the previous one. `helm uninstall` is still guarded after it, though it runs with the failed revision's values: it also counts ManagedWorkloads the operator took on outside them.

## CRD Compatibility

Hybernate follows these CRD versioning rules:

- **v1alpha1**: Breaking changes may occur between minor versions. Always read release notes.
- Field additions are non-breaking (new optional fields with defaults).
- Field removals or type changes are breaking and will be called out in release notes.

The CRD is kept when the chart is uninstalled, so uninstalling and reinstalling never deletes your ManagedWorkloads.

### Values a newer CRD rejects

A newer CRD can reject values an older one stored. `idleAfter` and `wake.maxWait` are now checked as Go parses durations, and `maxWait` is at most `1h`. If you wrote one that isn't a Go duration, such as `1d` or `2w`, the operator and the doorman can't read any ManagedWorkload (`time: unknown unit "d" in duration "1d"`), so they can't sync and don't start, and every write to that ManagedWorkload, its status too, is rejected until it's fixed. A valid duration that's only out of range, such as a `maxWait` of `2h`, keeps working: CRD validation ratcheting, on by default from Kubernetes 1.30, lets writes through while the value is unchanged, and the doorman holds connections for `1h` at most anyway. Fix it the next time you edit it.

To find them, list every value:

```bash
kubectl get managedworkloads -A -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.namespace}/{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.spec.idlePolicy.idleAfter}{"\t"}{.spec.wake.maxWait}{"\n"}{end}'
```

And fix each one with a value in hours, minutes or seconds:

```bash
kubectl patch managedworkload my-api -n staging --type merge -p '{"spec":{"idlePolicy":{"idleAfter":"24h"}}}'
```

## Forecast Engine State

The forecast engine state is serialized in each ManagedWorkload's status, in `status.prediction.state`. On upgrade:

- Compatible state versions are imported automatically
- State that can't be read, from an incompatible version or a hand edit, is discarded, and the engine re-learns from scratch, with a `ForecastReset` warning event

## Rollback

If something goes wrong:

=== "Helm"

    ```bash
    helm rollback hybernate -n hybernate-system
    ```

=== "kubectl"

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/okedeji/hybernate/releases/download/vPREVIOUS/install.yaml
    ```

Paused workloads remain paused during rollback. The previous operator version resumes managing them. Rolling back across a breaking API change isn't supported.
